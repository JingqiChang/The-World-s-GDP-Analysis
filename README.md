# The Relationship Between Environment and GDP Analysis
## To analyze the fectors affect CO2 emissions and will these fectors affect the growth of GDP

### Data Sources: 
the World Bank

### Metrics:
forest area (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.FRST.ZS)

Fossil fuel energy consumption (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.USE.COMM.FO.ZS)

Alternative and nuclear energy (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.USE.COMM.CL.ZS)

Electricity production from coal sources (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.COAL.ZS)

Renewable energy consumption (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.FEC.RNEW.ZS)

### Analyze fectors:

CO2 emission per capita (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC)

GDP per capita (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD)

### Analyze Report

At first, the average CO2 emission for each person was the highest in West Asia, and higher in Europe and North America than other countries in the nearest 2 decades. Because I considered the counties' who's CO2 emission is the most than others, so the map only showed top 30 countries with highest CO2 emission per capita.

TO consider the relationship between CO2 Emission and GDP, I divided the coountries with high income countries, middle income countries and low income countries.
I finded that the countries who had higher CO2 emissions was more likely to be a high imcome country.
(Blue cricle is high income country, yellow circle is middle income country and red circle is low income country)
